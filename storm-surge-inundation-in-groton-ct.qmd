### *Description*

With sea levels projected to rise as a result of climate-related factors, coastal flooding from storm surge, waves, and intense rainfall are becoming an increasingly more important concern for coastal communities.

The map above was created for a project in the Cartographic Techniques (GEOG 3510) course at the University of Connecticut in which I assumed the role of an environmental consultant tasked with estimating the number of residents in the coastal Connecticut town of Groton potentially impacted from the storm surge of a category 4 hurricane.

I then proposed locations for shelter and aid stations where supplies could be stockpiled and rescue crews could be stationed.

Finally, I communicated my results via the short PowerPoint presentation below:
