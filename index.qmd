### *Hello, thank you for visiting my website!*

I am primarily interested in geospatial technologies and spatial analysis as a means to extract useful information from spatial data of all types. My appreciation of geography began with an interest in exploring social and economic differences across the US through a qualitative lens. After being introduced to GIS, I increasingly gained an appreciation of maps as unique and powerful data visualization tools.

Currently, I am looking to further develop my Python and R programming skills while exploring the field of spatial data science. I encourage you to view my [portfolio](portfolio.qmd) of selected projects.
