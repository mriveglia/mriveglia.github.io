### *Hello, thank you for visiting my website!*

I am a GIS Technician Helper at Eversource Energy and a graduate student of the Master of Applied Geospatial Information Systems and Technologies (MAGIST) program at UCLA.

I'm interested in geospatial technologies and spatial analysis as a means to extract useful information from spatial data of all types.

My current goals are to increase my knowledge of the utilities industry while exploring the field of spatial data science and taking my geospatial programming skills to the next level.
