### *Description*

The map above was created for a project in the Cartographic Techniques course (GEOG 3510) at the University of Connecticut. The goal of the project was to address challenges in statistical mapping by learning and applying different techniques, classification schemes, and symbolization methods to a dataset containing the population of enslaved individuals during 1799 in Connecticut by town.

A second map (not shown) was also created for this project, using the same data, which purposefully used misleading map design in order to overstate the enslaved population. Many of the subtle strategies of deception used in the misleading second map were expressed in the book How to Lie With Maps by Mark Monmonier.

Overall, this project allowed me to improve on my ability to critically examine maps created by other people and improve the design and communication of my own maps.
