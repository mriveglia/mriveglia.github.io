### *Description*

This app was created for a project in the Mobile GIS (GEOG 4518) course at the University of Connecticut.

Nearly every town in Connecticut has a public library, each with unique collections emphasizing local history and culture. In addition to being great places to read, work, and study, public libraries provide spaces for local residents to connect with each other through the hosting of in-person and virtual programs, providing internet access and digital services training for workplace skills development and promoting environments which foster learning in children and adults through exposure and access to free reading material and educational services.

In addition, the stateâ€™s many museums, galleries, and other educational attractions provide the public opportunities to learn and offer insight into historically significant artifacts and ideas.

The purpose of this app is to draw attention to the many public libraries and other attractions within the state while providing an interface that is easy to navigate for all users. It is designed for residents of Connecticut with local knowledge and visitors alike so that they may be encouraged to further explore these areas.

The data for attractions including museums, art galleries, public works of art, and aquariums was obtained from Open Street Map using the OSM plugin in QGIS while data on public libraries was obtained from the website publiclibraries.com.
