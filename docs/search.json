This raw dataset was supplied to each team by the judges.\nThe R script below was used to transform the provided data set to allow it to work with the Flowmap City website. This is mainly achieved through the tidyverse collection of packages:\n\nsetwd(\"~/UConn - BS GIS/Cyberinfrastructure Competition\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Start Trips\nflows_StartTime &lt;- read_csv(\"Trip Tables/TripData4.csv\",\n                            col_types = cols(\n                              starttime = col_datetime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n                              ))\nnames(flows_StartTime) = c('...1', 'tripduration', 'starttime',\n                           'stoptime', 'start_station_id', 'start_station_name',\n                           'start_station_latitude', 'start_station_longitude',\n                           'end_station_id', 'end_station_name', 'end_station_latitude',\n                           'end_station_longitude', 'bikeid', 'usertype',\n                           'birthyear', 'gender')\n\nflows_StartTime_Count &lt;- flows_StartTime %&gt;%\n  group_by(start_station_id, end_station_id, starttime) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n())\n\nwrite_csv(flows_StartTime_Count, file = \"TripData4-Flows-Start-Time-Count.csv\")\n\n\n# End Trips\nflows_EndTime &lt;- read_csv(\"Trip Tables/TripData4.csv\",\n                          col_types = cols(\n                            stoptime = col_datetime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n                            ))\n\nnames(flows_EndTime) = c('...1', 'tripduration', 'starttime',\n                           'stoptime', 'start_station_id', 'start_station_name',\n                           'start_station_latitude', 'start_station_longitude',\n                           'end_station_id', 'end_station_name', 'end_station_latitude',\n                           'end_station_longitude', 'bikeid', 'usertype',\n                           'birthyear', 'gender')\n\nflows_EndTime_Count &lt;- flows_EndTime %&gt;%\n  group_by(start_station_id, end_station_id, stoptime) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n())\n\nwrite_csv(flows_EndTime_Count, file = \"TripData4-Flows-End-Time-Count.csv\")\n\nThis result was used by the team as a way to explore initial trends in raw trip volume between stations in space and time. Each point represents a bike share dock while the directional arrows between stations represent the travel from one station to a another.\nNote that, by default, Flowmap City clusters bike stations that are near in space to promote ease of viewing. This setting can be changed if desired.\nAs part of this competition, I was able to strengthen my skills working in an interdisciplinary team while exploring concepts in machine learning and GeoAI."

In addition to being great places to read, work, and study, public libraries provide spaces for local residents to connect with each other through the hosting of in-person and virtual programs, providing internet access and digital services training for workplace skills development and promoting environments which foster learning in children and adults through exposure and access to free reading material and educational services.\nIn addition, the state’s many museums, galleries, and other educational attractions provide the public opportunities to learn and offer insight into historically significant artifacts and ideas.\nThe purpose of this app is to draw attention to the many public libraries and other attractions within the state while providing an interface that is easy to navigate for all users. It is designed for residents of Connecticut with local knowledge and visitors alike so that they may be encouraged to further explore these areas.\nThe data for attractions including museums, art galleries, public works of art, and aquariums was obtained from Open Street Map using the OSM plugin in QGIS while data on public libraries was obtained from the website publiclibraries.com."

The goal of the project was to address challenges in statistical mapping by learning and applying different techniques, classification schemes, and symbolization methods to a dataset containing the population of enslaved individuals during 1799 in Connecticut by town.\nA second map (not shown) was also created for this project which purposefully used misleading map design in order to overstate the enslaved population. This was done as an exercise to apply some of the subtle strategies of deception expressed in the book How to Lie With Maps by Mark Monmonier.\nThe data used in this project originates from from radicalcartography.net (website of William Rankin).\nOverall, this project allowed me to improve on my ability to critically examine maps created by others and improve the design and communication of my own maps."
