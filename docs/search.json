I then proposed locations for shelter and aid stations where supplies could be stockpiled and medical personnel and rescue crews could be stationed. Finally, I communicated my results via the short PowerPoint presentation below."

My appreciation of geography began with an interest in exploring social and economic differences across the US through a qualitative lens. After being introduced to GIS, I increasingly gained an appreciation of maps as unique and powerful data visualization tools.\nCurrently, I am looking to further develop my Python and R programming skills while exploring the field of spatial data science. I encourage you to view my portfolio of selected projects."

The points represent bike share docks while the directional arrows between stations represent the travel from one station to a another.\nBy default bike stations near in space will be clustered to promote ease of viewing by stopping the display of too many trips on screen at once. As part of this competition, I was able to strengthen my skills working in an interdisciplinary team while exploring concepts in machine learning and GeoAI."

The goal of the project was to address challenges in statistical mapping by learning and applying different techniques, classification schemes, and symbolization methods to a dataset containing the population of enslaved individuals during 1799 in Connecticut by town.\nA second map (not shown) was also created for this project, using the same data, which purposefully used misleading map design in order to overstate the enslaved population. Many of the subtle strategies of deception used in the misleading second map were expressed in the book How to Lie With Maps by Mark Monmonier.\nOverall, this project allowed me to improve on my ability to critically examine maps created by other people and improve the design and communication of my own maps."
